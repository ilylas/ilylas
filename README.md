My name is Ilyes Aljane, and I'm a 20-year-old backend developer based in Mednine, Ghomrassen, Tunisia, currently pursuing my studies at the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Charguia. My expertise lies in backend development, where I have honed my skills in popular frameworks such as Django and Express, as well as databases such as Redis, Postgres, and MongoDB. Additionally, I possess a basic knowledge of Docker, DevOps, and automation, which I believe are essential for modern software development. I have a passion for staying up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the tech industry, and I am always eager to learn more about these topics. Continuously seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve my skills as a developer is one of my top priorities.
